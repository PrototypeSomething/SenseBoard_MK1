# SenseBoard_MK1
What is Sense? 
The sense project started as a thought, a thought about creating a nice analogue open-sourced keyboard, preferably as affordable as possible.

The SenseBoard MK1 is the first keyboard in the Sense lineup and will develop into a finished product when the time comes.

Note: This project is very much a Work in progress and is maintained by a student, so expect unregular commits
