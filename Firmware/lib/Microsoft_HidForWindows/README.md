# Project

Windows natively utilizes many HID controls, exposing hardware integration-points to enhance user-experience.  While HID is a well-understood industry standard, the great flexibility of HID Report descriptors introduces complexity for the consumer (e.g. Applications, Hosts) to parse and support, so only a subset of what HIDs can describe may be supported (with great variance amongst consumers).  The inevitability of errors/deviations in shipped device/consumer implementations from the HID-spec and the need to maintain backwards compatibility, further reduce what can be usefully described.

This project provides reference-implementations of HIDs that Windows natively consumes as hardware integration-points (e.g. Shell-interaction, Application-WindowMessages, UserMode APIs).  (*Note: 3rd-Party applications are naturally not limited to only what Windows natively consumes*).  References document (inline) any Windows expectations/limitations/work-arounds, and generally why things are the way they are.

> References are intended to be used as a starting-point for 3rd-Party HID vendors, and to be consumed as-is by hobbyists.

> This project is available as a library via the [Arduino Package Manager](https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/microsoft_hidforwindows/).  Search for `Microsoft_HidForWindows`.

## Supported Devices

> Additional devices will be continually added over the coming months.  To make suggestions for the next device-type, please file an issue.

- Consumer Control  (see `Microsoft_HidConsumerControl.h`)
- LampArray (see `Microsoft_HidLampArray.h`)
  - New support in Windows as part of [Dynamic Lighting](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/07/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23475/)
- System Control (see `Microsoft_HidSystemControl.h`)
- Telephony Headset (see `Microsoft_HidTelephonyHeadset.h`)
- Wireless Radio Control (see `Microsoft_HidWirelessRadioControl.h`)

## Caveats
- Untested on non-Windows systems (e.g. macOS, Linux, etcâ€¦)
- Comprehension/simplicity was always chosen over efficiency  (e.g. multiple Reports used, where one would be sufficient).  See [HID-spec](https://usb.org/document-library/device-class-definition-hid-111) and [Waratah](https://github.com/microsoft/hidtools) for rolling-your-own Report Descriptor.
- A subset of HID Report Descriptor variations within the HID-spec are naturally supported, but likely not all.
- Documented expectations/work-arounds may change at any time, and do not guarantee compatibility.
  - Last Validated on Windows 11 (22621.1702) (`22621.1.amd64fre.ni_release.220506-1250`)
